        My journey with the Speedmaster began when I was looking for my first luxury timepiece. I’d just started exploring mechanical watches and had been rotating between a Hamilton Jazzmaster Viewmatic 37 (H32455557) and a 1964 Omega Seamaster (reference 165.002). I wanted to add a versatile piece to my collection, one that I could wear at the office and on the weekends. I was seeking out a well-designed piece—something with heritage, class, and value.

<h3>Switzerland vs Germany</h3>
I flirted with the possibility of picking up a Sinn 556i or 556a because of my appreciation for German design and masculine dials. The 556i looked new, minimal, and had a top-grade Swiss movement. It had a rugged no-nonsense toolwatch presence with a glossy black dial and thick indices. The 556a variant had a unique 4:00 date window that was “corrected” so that it always displayed horizontally, a subtle detail indicative of the nature of those behind it. Both had a caseback that revealed the beautifully displayed top-grade ETA 2824-2 movement with blued screws, swirling perlage effect, and the modified Sinn gold rotor. It made total sense to buy a brand new Sinn; my logical brain had already made a decision, but as with all decisions, the heart has a say.

<h3>Variations of the Reduced</h3>
I began my search for the Speedmaster “Reduced” poking around in the usual places: eBay, Chrono24, and Reddit’s Watchexchange, but nothing was catching my eye. Since it was not a new release, I needed to navigate this journey with all of the cautions involved with seeking out a pre-owned timepiece. I had discovered that two models were readily available: the older 3510.50 variant with hesalite acrylic crystal and minutes on the dial, and the newer and rarer 3539.50 variant with sapphire crystal and indices that mirror the classic Speedmaster design. From an aesthetic standpoint there was no question that the latter suited my taste a bit better and was overall the better watch. Every collection needs a chronograph, and what better chronograph than a Speedy? Yes, the Speedmaster Automatic would be more difficult to service and cost twice the price of the Sinns, but from all of the photos I had looked at it appeared as though the Speedmaster would fit my wrist better—both tangibly and figuratively.

<h3>Journey to Japan</h3>
Through various forums I learned about eLady, a second-hand Japanese accessories store that had a reputation for reliability and authenticity. At the time, eLady updated its inventory every Monday and so for a couple of months every week of mine started with an inventory check. My requirements were that the watch must have an “A grade” ranking and include a clean inner and outer box, warranty cards, and manual.

After sifting through what seemed to be a million used 3510.50 models (most without boxes and some with boxes that appeared to have been submerged in saltwater for a decade), I finally found an unpolished near-mint condition 3539.50 with bracelet, box, and papers. It was the best looking one I had seen for a fantastic price—and upon delivery it turned out to be virtually brand new. The only flaw was a microscopic ding in the tachymeter at 65 (which was visible in the photos). For well under 2k I am glad I bought it, as prices have skyrocketed since then. My only fear is that it may cost somewhere in the ballpark of $750 to be serviced by Omega (mainly due to the piggyback chronograph which is basically disposable), but since it’s from 2012 I’ll likely run it until something goes terribly wrong.

      <h2>Seiko Prospex PADI “Mini Turtle” SRPC41J1</h2>
      <p class="specs">42.3 mm case / 20 mm lug width / 13 mm thick / 42.5 mm lug to lug / hardlex / 200m water resistance / hacking / automatic / hand-winding</p>
      <img class="hero" src="images/seiko-mini-turtle.jpeg" alt="Seiko Prospex PADI “Mini Turtle” SRPC41J1">
      <div class="content">
        To replace my SKX013, I decided on a whim (which essentially means I only researched it for about a month) to nab the SRPC41J1 from Gnomon Watches. At just under $400, I found the Mini Turtle to be a more than reasonable value considering it’s competition from brands like Hamilton, Squale, and Steinhart. And combined with a smaller case design similar in wearability to the SKX013, Seiko knew what they were doing with this one.

<h3>Strap Replacement</h3>
Right out of the box I traded the included blue rubber strap for a grey-stitch patterned sailcloth band. Rubber to me always feels a bit stuffy and since I plan to wear this guy mainly in the summer, I felt sailcloth to be the natural choice.

Of all of the canvas/sailcloth style straps I’ve tried, I prefer the straps offered at iWantAStrap.com. Due to the lack of leather backing, these bands are far more breathable than the multi-layered offerings from the likes of Hadley-Roma and Hirsch. They do take awhile to break in, but in my opinion they are a perfect combination of texture and length; rugged and canvas-like, they lie somewhere between a short and medium length which avoids the issue of too much excess after buckling it on the wrist.

<h3>SKX013 Comparison</h3>
So why did I buy it? Well, for me this fits into the same casual/dive category as the SKX013 that I had been wearing for a few years; it’s a little wider, but just as the SKX007 and Turtle look more at home on a larger wrist, the SKX013 and Mini Turtle are more compact solutions of the same size class.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hand-winding</strong> – As the SKX013 was a go-to casual piece in my collection, I frequently had to do the “Seiko shuffle” to get it going after the power reserve had run its course, so I wanted something that I could just wind a few times and go.</li>
  <li><strong>No Day Window</strong> – I hate day/date complications and I hate setting them. Never, ever have I looked at my watch to find out what day it was. It’s an extraneous feature that also interferes with dial symmetry.</li>
  <li><strong>Size</strong> – Although it’s the largest watch in my collection, the Mini Turtle wears wonderfully for a piece above that sweet 40mm spot.</li>
  <li><strong>Made in Japan</strong> – Does it really matter? I don’t know. Maybe it just feels better psychologically.</li>
  <li><strong>Dat Dial</strong> – With far more attention to detail than the SKX013, the dial is a huge part of what makes this watch look upscale.</li>
</ul>

If I could sum up the comparison in one word it would be <em>substantial</em>. The quality of the Turtle feels an order of magnitude more substantial than the SKX013 when it comes to quality of design, movement, and execution. I would recommend the Mini Turtle to anyone looking for a more “posh” version of the SKX013 or to someone looking to downsize their “real” Turtle to something more compact. It’s a great one to just throw on casually and the Pepsi bezel gives it that “summer-watch” feel that goes great with jeans and a t-shirt. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: you just can’t go wrong with a Seiko.

        <h3>Hydrophobes Welcomed</h3>
Even the most hydrophobic enthusiast needs a dive watch in their rotation, and Seiko arguably offers the most value in this segment. Having owned the elusive Orient 2ER00001B as my first submergible and finding it just a bit too large for my wrists, I regrettably sold it and explored alternatives.

<h3>007 vs 013</h3>
The Seiko SKX007 is the go-to for entry level automatic dive watches, but coming in at just around 42mm I thought it would wear a bit too large for my taste. Enter the SKX013: the baby brother to the 007. Aside from the unavoidable scaling down that is necessary with case size and dial proportions, the only notable aesthetic difference between the two is the seconds hand: the 007 wields a lollipop style while the 013 displays a more modest arrow design.

<h3>Orient vs Seiko</h3>
Other watches I’d considered in this segment were from Orient; both the Mako and Ray are tempting offerings from a solid company that operates within the same parent organization as Seiko. A case could be made for either one, but ultimately for me it came down to size.

<h3>Fast and Loose</h3>
My experience with the SKX013 has been mediocre at best, but I still find myself putting it on my wrist more than any other casual watch in my collection. At about +45.4 seconds per day (according to Toolwatch.io) it runs far too fast to keep it moving for more than a few days at a time which can be frustrating.

After about 2 years, the rotor came loose which prompted me to have to remove the case back and tighten it up with a small screwdriver. Though it wasn’t a big deal, I wasn’t particularly keen on opening it up, as I occasionally wear this while swimming and performing maintenance on my saltwater aquarium. Fortunately, its water resistance does not appear to have been compromised.

<h3>A Permanent Piece</h3>
The SKX watches pair wonderfully with the perlon straps that Eulit offers. I find them to suit the watches aesthetically as well as functionally, as they are far more breathable in the summer than anything else I’ve tried.

Overall I would absolutely recommend this watch to anyone who wants to throw something on and not have to worry about it getting beat up. Loose rotor issue aside, it’s a robust watch that looks good enough to wear to a casual restaurant as well as swim with at the beach. Seiko certainly got it right with the SKX series, and my collection would undoubtedly be incomplete without one.

        <h3>A Journey to Boston</h3>
Hours before the sun rose on a cold February morning, I hopped on board what would be a 13 hour train ride from Erie, PA to Boston, MA. My weekend plan was set in motion after buying a ticket to attend the AWCI-hosted “Build a Watch” event I’d discovered on EventBrite a month prior.

From reading about the event, I knew three things:
<ol>
  <li>I’d be building a 44mm flieger style watch</li>
  <li>I’d be assembling a hand-wound ETA 6497 movement</li>
  <li>Lunch would be provided</li>
</ol>

<h3>Saturday</h3>
After the same car alarm interrupted my sleep several times throughout the night, I woke up just minutes before my real alarm was set and tediously unwrapped the dry-out-your-skin mini hotel soap and took a shower. I got dressed, strapped on my Omega Speedmaster, and ordered an egg and cheese croissant with a cup of black coffee from the hotel cafe.

Once we were welcomed in, we rode the elevator to the third floor, passed through a set of french doors, and leisurely chose where we would sit for the next 8 hours. I settled into the front row window seat, figuring I’d get a bit more natural light that way. Atop each workstation was a watchmaker’s bench, a Bergeon tool set, and a pillbox full of tiny parts that were conveniently organized in the order of assembly.

Bluetooth remote in-hand, Aaron began to sift through a presentation, each slide illustrating a tiny piece of how, by the time the sun set, we were to transform these raw metal bits into a sophisticated portable pendulum. Each step was carefully explained while the watchmakers roamed the room checking our work and helping us out in any way they could.

<h3>Reflections</h3>
The most surprising takeaway from my experience was that the movement we worked with was large, even by modern standards, meaning I can’t even imagine the amount of precision involved in manipulating smaller movements. I have a respect for watchmakers that I’d only had in theory before. Actually doing the work made me realize how intricate everything is and how much control one needs to have over one’s hands and mind.

        <h3>The Absence of Color</h3>
Back in March of 2019, I’d read on Hodinkee and Worn and Wound that Hamilton was to release a white-dialed Khaki Field Mechanical watch that was available for pre-order exclusively at Topper’s. Since I work in a business environment and am pretty much set on dress pieces (famous last words), the release caught my interest, but I didn’t put much thought into it.

<h3>Ruggedly Handsome</h3>
Inspired in part by how classically cool John Lennon looked with his Vietnam gear in the 70s and how rough Hank Moody from Californication comes off, I decided that I needed something a bit more rugged.

<h3>Liquid Courage</h3>
After ruminating about it for a few weeks and, admittedly following a few glasses of dry red wine, I worked up the courage to put down the $200 deposit. It was well worth it to quell the voices in my head; sometimes you just have to remind yourself that life is short—just do it.

<h3>The Reveal</h3>
After the third and final delivery attempt it was finally mine; upon opening the packaging, I was surprised to find a light wood looking box, rather than the ordinary black you see with most Hamiltons. The seams were a little wavy which was a giveaway that it wasn’t real wood, and it felt slightly cheap, but I appreciated the effort.

<h3>Larger Than Life</h3>
As I was winding it up and admiring how the slightly raised numerals on the dial reflected the sunlight, I realized that this was a larger dial than I had anticipated. It is a stunning, unmistakably bright white, but combined with the long lug-to-lug length, it wears much larger than one would think.

Ultimately, I chose to send this gem back, as it wore much larger than I had anticipated. A field watch should be small, no larger than 37 mm, and this one just doesn’t make the cut for me.
